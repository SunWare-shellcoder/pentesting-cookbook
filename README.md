## Description

    ╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ Snippets, code samples and hints used in penetration  │░
    │ tests stored in a single repository so it can be      │░
    │ quickly accessed and searched during assessments.     │░
    │ Some of these were collected around the Web, some     │░
    │ developed. Feel free to contribute!                   │░

## Notes

* Since this handbook was not originally intended to be shared some parts may miss their original sources. I'll do my best to give proper credits and I hope you can help me with that.
* Formatting may seem quite exotic at first but this is the way I prefer to read. Thanks to indentation I can instantly see hierarchy and quickly scan interesting sections.
* This documentation structure gives best results with quick open, multi-line editing and full-text search options available in some popular text editors (like Sublime Text or VS Code).

## Bootstraping scripts

Fast and easy way to set up a hardened pentesting environment (currently Kali only) both for x86 and arm (Raspberry PI):

    $ cd bootstrap
    $ sudo USERNAME=user ./run.kali.x86.sh

More information in `bootstrap/README.md`.

## Formatting / structure rules

* If there are more than three levels of hierarchy the file needs to be split.
* Categories in file names are separated with ".".
* If there is not enough in given category they can be grouped with "+".
* Commands: "~".
* Lists: "- ".
* Comments: "# ".
* OS specific commands:
    * ~$ (Unix)
    * ~> (Windows)
* Shell specific commands:
    * ~PS> (Powershell)
* Variables:
    * VAR_ATTACKER_HOST
    * VAR_ATTACKER_PORT
    * VAR_TARGET_DOMAIN
    * VAR_TARGET_HOST
    * VAR_TARGET_PORT
    * VAR_TARGET_CIDR
    * VAR_TARGET_RANGE
    * VAR_USERNAME
    * VAR_PASSWORD
    * VAR_HASH
    * VAR_STRING
    * VAR_INTEGER
    * VAR_HEX
    * VAR_WORDLIST
    * VAR_*_HOST (VAR_FTP_HOST, VAR_ZOMBIE_HOST, VAR_PROXY_HOST etc)
